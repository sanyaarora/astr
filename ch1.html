  <h2> Probability Concepts (Chapters 2, 3, and 4) </h2>
      <div class = "container-fluid">

          <div class="jumbotron vertical-center" style="background-color: #f2e6dc">
            <p class="text"> This section of the course focused on general probability concepts, probability distributions, and hypothesis testing.
              Probability measures the likelihood of events occurring within a given set of possible outcomes.
              It's useful in assessing risk, making predictions, and making decisions under uncertainty. Probability ranges from 0 (an event that will not
              occur) to 1 (an event that is certain to occur).<br> </p>


              <p class="text"> A probability distribution details how probabilities are distributed across different outcomes of a random variable, giving
                 the probabilities of different possible outcomes for an experiment.
                These distributions can be discrete, where the outcomes are distinct and separate (for example rolling a die), or continuous, involving outcomes
                that can take on continuous values (for example the heights of adults). Some common probability distributions are: <br> </p>
                <ul class="text">
                <li>Binomial Distribution: Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, with each trial having the same probability of success.
                  For example, flipping a coin multiple times.
                </li>
                <li>Poisson Distribution: Used to model the number of times an event happens in a fixed interval of time, assuming that these events occur with a
                  known constant mean and independently of time.
                </li>
                <li>
                Normal Distribution: Also known as Gaussian, describes how the values of a variable are distributed. It is symmetric and describes many
                natural phenomena, especially when there are many small, independent effects acting concurrently. It is characterized by its bell-shaped curve. </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text"> Confidence intervals provide a range of values which are believed to contain the true value of a population parameter with a certain probability.
                  This is important for knowing the accuracy of statistical estimates. For example, if researchers measure the mean height of a sample of trees and calculate
                  a 95% confidence interval, they can be 95% confident that the interval contains the true mean height of the population. <br> </p>

                <p class="text"> Hypothesis testing is used to estimate the validity of a claim about a population based on sample data. It starts with a null hypothesis
                  that represents a default position. We then use sample data to determine if we can reject the null hypothesis. Some common hypohtesis tests are: <br> </p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Z-test: Used when we know the population variance and the sample size is large, this test checks whether the means of two datasets are different.
                  </li>
                  <li>T-test: Used when the population variance is unknown and the sample size is small. This test also compares the means of two datasets.
                  </ul>
